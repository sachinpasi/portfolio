            I’m Sachin Pasi. I’m a designer who codes. I care deeply about
            creating world-class, useful, and beautiful products that help
            people and make a difference. I can be as involved in your project
            as you need me to be; from the seed of the idea, to sketches,
            creative direction, design, and the front-end.
